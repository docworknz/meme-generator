can you use nextjs 16 to refactor this app: 1) users should be required to sign in before posting/upvoting; 2) the meme generator remain as the creation tool with a separate gallery/feed view; 3)I want instantDB to be my database, here is my public app Id:9c63eab6-a43a-42ae-b6a0-d401cc2082ba 4)use instantDB storage and instantDB auth with magic link, it will send me a 6 digit sign in code
